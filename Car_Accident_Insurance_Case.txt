Car Accident Insurance Case Study

Chapter 1: Introduction to the Case

Accidents are unpredictable and often leave people with not only physical injuries but also significant financial consequences. This case study illustrates how auto insurance operates in a real-world scenario, highlighting key policy elements, claims processing, and legal-ethical dynamics.

On the afternoon of May 12, 2025, at approximately 4:45 PM, a significant car accident occurred in downtown Chicago, at the intersection of Lincoln Avenue and Maple Street. The weather was clear, visibility excellent, and road conditions dry—ideal for driving. Despite these favorable conditions, an error in judgment led to a collision between two vehicles, triggering the insurance mechanisms that would follow.

Chapter 2: The People and the Vehicles

Ms. Emily Ross, a 34-year-old office manager, was driving her 2020 Toyota Corolla northbound on Lincoln Avenue. She had a clean driving record and maintained a full-coverage auto insurance policy.

Mr. Daniel Vega, a 42-year-old delivery contractor, was operating his 2018 Ford F-150. He held a liability-only policy and was headed eastbound on Maple Street.

According to witness statements and traffic camera footage, Ms. Ross entered the intersection under a green light. Mr. Vega, however, failed to stop at a red light and entered the same intersection, leading to a T-bone collision. The impact struck the passenger side of Ms. Ross’s car, deploying airbags and causing immediate damage.

Chapter 3: Immediate Aftermath and Damages

Police Response: Officers arrived within minutes, documented the incident, and filed an official report concluding that Mr. Vega was at fault for ignoring a traffic control signal. No citation was issued to Ms. Ross.

Damages:

Ms. Ross’s Toyota Corolla suffered severe structural damage to the passenger side, broken windows, frame damage, and deployed airbags. Estimated repair costs totaled $9,700.

Mr. Vega’s Ford F-150 sustained moderate front-end damage with an estimated repair cost of $3,200.

Injuries: Ms. Ross complained of shoulder pain and dizziness at the scene. She was treated at a nearby urgent care center and referred to physical therapy. Mr. Vega was unharmed.

Chapter 4: Understanding Insurance Coverage

Ms. Ross’s Full Coverage (State Auto):

Bodily Injury Liability: $100,000/person

Property Damage Liability: $50,000

Medical Payments Coverage: $5,000

Collision Coverage: $500 deductible

Mr. Vega’s Liability-Only Policy (Midwest Mutual):

Bodily Injury Liability: $50,000/person

Property Damage Liability: $25,000

Full coverage provided Ms. Ross with both liability protection and direct coverage for her injuries and vehicle, while Mr. Vega’s policy only covered third-party liabilities—offering no coverage for his own vehicle or any medical costs he may have incurred.

Chapter 5: The Claims Process – Step-by-Step

Notification: Ms. Ross notified her insurer within one hour. Mr. Vega’s report came the following morning.

Investigation: Insurers gathered the police report, dashcam footage, and photographs. Fault was clearly assigned to Mr. Vega.

Medical Claim: Ms. Ross’s insurer covered her $3,900 medical bills under the Medical Payments provision.

Vehicle Damage: Ms. Ross’s car was repaired by her insurer after paying a $500 deductible.

Subrogation: Her insurer recovered $13,600 from Mr. Vega’s insurer and reimbursed Ms. Ross her deductible.

Chapter 6: Ethics, Law, and Resolution

Despite the potential for litigation, both parties avoided court due to timely admission of liability and fair handling of the claims. Ethical handling included:

Prompt communication from both insurers

Honoring of policy terms

Accurate damage assessment

This highlights the importance of:

Transparent reporting

Good-faith cooperation

Timely documentation and medical attention

Chapter 7: Lessons and Best Practices

For Drivers:

Always obey traffic signals.

Maintain full coverage if possible.

Document the scene with photos and statements.

For Insurers:

Support clients with clear communication.

Act swiftly in assigning adjusters and processing claims.

Collaborate in subrogation for quick financial recovery.

For Policyholders:

Understand what each part of your insurance covers.

Know your policy limits and out-of-pocket responsibilities.

Keep your insurer’s contact handy in emergencies.

Chapter 8: Concluding Analysis

This case study demonstrates how a single traffic violation can result in significant financial consequences for all involved. Ms. Ross’s full coverage policy provided a safety net that not only protected her health but ensured quick recovery of vehicle damages. Mr. Vega, though not injured, faced significant financial exposure due to his limited coverage and being at fault.

The seamless cooperation between insurers and a well-documented incident allowed for a smooth resolution. This underscores the value of comprehensive insurance, ethical claim handling, and personal responsibility behind the wheel.

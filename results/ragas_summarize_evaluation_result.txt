Executive Summary
On May 12, 2025, a serious traffic collision occurred at the intersection of
Lincoln and Maple Street in Chicago, involving Emily Ross, a 34-year-old office manager, and Daniel
Vega, a delivery driver. The incident resulted from Daniel's failure to stop at a red light while
Emily was legally proceeding through the intersection on a green light. The crash caused significant
damage to both vehicles and left Emily momentarily unconscious. In response to the incident, the
city later implemented safety measures at the intersection. Following the accident, Emily expressed
satisfaction with her insurance experience, while Daniel began taking steps to improve his driving
skills and coverage. By September 1, 2025, Daniel's claim was recognized by Midwest Mutual's
subrogation department as an "EXEMPLARY RESOLUTION – COOPERATIVE THIRD PARTY," contributing to their
quarterly analysis on liability efficiency.

Key Events Timeline

Chicago, heading to her mother’s home in Evanston for their weekly dinner tradition. She drives a
2020 Toyota Corolla.
**May 12, 2025, 4:44 PM**: Daniel Vega, a delivery driver, is nearing the end
of his twelve-hour shift. He is fatigued and has not eaten since the morning. He is driving a 2018
Ford F-150 and is under pressure from dispatch to complete his deliveries quickly.
**May 12, 2025, 4:45 PM**: The collision occurs at the intersection of Lincoln and Maple Street. Emily enters the
intersection legally under a green light, while Daniel's truck runs a red light, resulting in a
T-bone collision. Witnesses describe the crash as extremely loud and violent. Emily briefly loses
consciousness due to the impact.
**May 12, 2025, 4:48 PM**: Officer Kevin Mitchell arrives on site with backup.
EMTs tend to Emily, who complains of dizziness and shoulder pain. Daniel refuses
medical attention but admits, “I thought I had the yellow.” Officer Mitchell begins documenting the
scene and logging witness accounts. 
**May 12, 2025, 5:02 PM**: The intersection is partially closed.
Officer Mitchell documents skid marks, debris fields, and damage angles, while a bus driver
provides dashcam footage that later proves key in assigning fault. The traffic light clearly turned

would cover the damage to Emily and her car but nothing for his own repairs or injuries. Daniel
protests, but Phil explains the severity of the situation. - **May 14, 2025, 2:30 PM**: Derek Chen
inspects Emily’s Corolla, noting significant damage with a repair estimate of $9,734. Medical

Intersection at Maple Street – Incident Summary
Executive Summary
On May 12, 2025, at a Chicago intersection, Emily Ross’s car was T-boned by a pickup truck after its driver, Daniel Vega, ran a red light. Ross suffered minor injuries, but her comprehensive auto insurance covered all resulting costs. A prompt investigation with clear evidence established Vega’s fault, and his insurer reimbursed the damages. The incident highlights the importance of attentive driving and adequate insurance coverage.
Key Events Timeline
* Accident & Immediate Response (May 12, 2025): Around 4:45 PM, Emily Ross (in a 2020 Toyota Corolla) entered the Lincoln & Maple intersection on a green light when Daniel Vega (in a 2018 Ford F-150) ran the red light and struck her car. Police and EMTs arrived within minutes. Emily sustained a mild concussion and shoulder injury and was treated at an urgent care; Vega was unhurt and admitted he thought the light was “yellow.” Witnesses and a dashcam video confirmed the light was red, clearly establishing Vega’s fault.

* Investigation & Claim Handling (May 13–20, 2025): Police documented the scene and collected evidence. Emily reported the accident to State Auto (her insurer), which promptly covered about $13,600 in damages (vehicle repairs and medical bills) for her, minus a $500 deductible. Daniel notified Midwest Mutual (his insurer) and learned his liability-only policy would not cover his own truck’s repairs. State Auto filed a subrogation claim, and by May 20, Midwest Mutual accepted liability and reimbursed State Auto approximately $13,634 (including Emily’s deductible refund). All claims were resolved with no cost to Emily.

* Aftermath: By late May, Emily’s car was fully repaired and she completed physical therapy, making a full recovery. Daniel paid roughly $3,300 out of pocket to fix his truck and later added collision coverage to his insurance. Both drivers moved forward after the incident.

Main Parties/Entities Involved
   * Emily Ross: Driver of the Toyota Corolla (accident victim), insured by State Auto.

   * Daniel Vega: Driver of the Ford F-150 (at fault), insured by Midwest Mutual (liability only).

   * State Auto: Emily’s auto insurer; paid her claims and recovered costs from the at-fault insurer.

   * Midwest Mutual: Daniel’s insurer; paid for Emily’s damages after fault was confirmed.

   * Chicago Police: Responded to the scene and documented the incident.

Critical Details and Context
No external factors (like weather or road conditions) contributed to the crash — it was caused by driver error. Vega had been working a long, pressure-filled day, which likely impaired his attention and led him to miss the red light. The side-impact collision was severe, but both drivers avoided any life-threatening injury. Crucial evidence (witness accounts and video footage) clearly established the timeline and fault, enabling a smooth, undisputed insurance process.
Outcomes and Implications
Emily was fully compensated for all losses and recovered without financial burden, thanks to her comprehensive coverage and efficient claims handling. By contrast, Daniel’s minimal insurance left him with a costly repair bill, highlighting the risk of inadequate coverage. The insurers’ cooperation through quick communication and subrogation demonstrated effective claim resolution grounded in clear evidence. Daniel’s experience also emphasized the dangers of driving while fatigued and underinsured, prompting him to be more cautious and better insured. Overall, this incident shows that proper insurance and responsible driving practices can greatly mitigate the impact of a serious accident.

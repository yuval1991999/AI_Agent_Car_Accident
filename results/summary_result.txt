The case study explores a car accident in downtown Chicago involving Ms. Emily Ross and Mr. Daniel Vega. 
Ms. Ross had full-coverage insurance, while Mr. Vega had liability-only coverage. 
The accident occurred when Mr. Vega ran a red light and collided with Ms. Ross. 
The study delves into the financial and legal implications of auto insurance, including key policy elements, 
claims processing, and the ethical dynamics of the insurance process. 
The police report found Mr. Vega at fault. Ms. Ross's Toyota Corolla incurred $9,700 in damages, 
while Mr. Vega's Ford F-150 had $3,200 in damages. 
Ms. Ross received medical treatment covered by her insurance, and her insurer recovered costs from Mr. Vega's insurer through subrogation. 
Both parties avoided litigation by admitting liability and handling claims fairly. The report emphasizes the importance of comprehensive insurance coverage, 
ethical claim handling, and personal responsibility in the event of a car accident. 
Key insurance terms are introduced to enhance understanding of the auto insurance process.

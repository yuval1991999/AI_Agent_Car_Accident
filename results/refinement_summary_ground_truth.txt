=== Intersection at Maple Street Summary (Refined) ===

On May 12, 2025, at 4:45 PM in downtown Chicago, a car accident occurred at the intersection of Lincoln Avenue and Maple Street. Emily Ross, driving a 2020 Toyota Corolla with full insurance coverage, was struck on the passenger side by Daniel Vega, who ran a red light in his 2018 Ford F-150. Vega only held liability insurance.

Police arrived quickly and confirmed Vega was at fault. Ms. Ross sustained minor injuries and her car was significantly damaged. Vega was unharmed but his vehicle had moderate damage.

Ross’s insurer covered her $3,900 medical expenses and $9,700 in vehicle repairs after a $500 deductible. Her insurer then recovered $13,600 from Vega’s insurer through subrogation. Ross was fully reimbursed with no out-of-pocket expenses.

The case highlights the legal and ethical cooperation between insurers. Timely reporting, accurate documentation, and comprehensive coverage ensured a smooth resolution. The study demonstrates the risks of inadequate coverage and the benefits of understanding one’s insurance policy.
